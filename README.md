<h1> Python: 100 days of coding Day 2</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
  Today I am learning about Data Types, number operators, Type Connversions, and f-strings. At the end of today, I am going to build a Tip Calculator.<br />
<br />

<h3>Task 1:</h3>
Write a program that adds the digits in a 2-digit number. e.g. if the input was 35, then the output should be 3 + 5 = 8:

</p>
<br />
<br />
<h3>Task 2:</h3> 
Math in Python: Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.
<br />

</p>
<br />
<align="left"> This code calculates BMI as weight in kg divided by height in meters squared.
</p>
<br /> 
<br />
<h3>Task 3:</h3>
Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many weeks we have left, if we live until 90 years old.

</p>
<br />
<br />
<h3>Task 4:</h3>
Create a Tip Calculator. The program will take into account 3 different variables, total bill, tip percentage, and how many people are splitting the bill, to calculate how much each person should pay.
<p align="center">

</p><br />
I had to look up how to format the bill so that it always shows 2 decimal places. The {:.2f} forces Python to format the answer correctly.
<br />
<br />
